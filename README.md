# A Study on Ethereum Security: Bridging Educational Gaps through the Development of Faillapop

This repository contains the **final year project for my Bachelor's Degree in Telematics Engineering at the University of Málaga**. The project, titled "A Study on Ethereum Security: Bridging Educational Gaps through the Development of Faillapop," explores the intricacies of Ethereum security and includes the development of an educational resource.

## Faillapop
[Faillapop](https://github.com/jcsec-security/faillapop) is an educational resource developed collaboratively with [José Carlos Ramírez](https://github.com/jcsec-security). It is composed of a series of smart contract that interact with each other to simulate a functional buy and sell platform which is designed to be intentionally vulnerable to a variety of attacks. That allow students to learn about Ethereum security in an environment that mimics real-life scenarios. Making the training more challenging and reflective of real conditions.
